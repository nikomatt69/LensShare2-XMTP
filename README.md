# ðŸŒ± LensShare

A decentralised video sharing social platform built on Lens Protocol. 
With LensShare, users can share and discover short videos through live streaming, uploads, and social shares. (TL:DR a decentralised TikTok)

Live Demo: [LensShare Testnet](http://LensShare-gamma.vercel.app)

For the best experience view on web (although mobile works too just not as much, autoplay not compatible on iOS, although android should be fine.)

## Summary

## Overview

A video sharing social media platform is a fun way for people to show each other what they are doing, or to share things they find funny or interesting. Other people can watch the videos and leave comments, or "like" them if they enjoy them creating social interactions and community. 

We set out to build a social media that cares more about the user, that wonâ€™t harvest user data (looking at you Tiktok!) and gives the content creator control over their own content. 

For full transparency we started to build LensShare as part of the Encode/WBW3 accelerator, the Next Build Hackathon began a week or so into it and we were encouraged to enter, and so have been building for both alongside each other. We have added new features since it finished in mid December. LensShare is also taking part in Buildspace N&W S2.

5.5) Uploading: budlr is a bit funny. You need to hvae a storage balance with them in order to upload.

PRess the black depoist button, enter the amount you want, click the second deposit button and then wait for it to refresh.

## Conclusion
Our aim when building LensShare was to try and make a contribution to a more decentralised social media, where users donâ€™t have to worry about their data, and where they have full control over their content. 

LensShare is built on chain and so is by nature decentralised, it uses decentralised protocols such as Lens and Livepeer. This means greater privacy and security for users, as their data is not stored on a central server that could be vulnerable to hacking or other security threats.

In addition to the core social features, LensShare also includes the Lens collect module. This feature allows users to take more control over their content.
Comments, encrypted with Lit Protocol give further user control on both the creator and user side.
